#DBMS assigment
##Rules:  
1) Please don't commit directly to master, commit to the dev branch and make a PR. The PR shall be merged/rebased accordingly, and after enough progress the entire branch shall be merged/rebased to master. This is safer than working directly on master, although merge conflicts may arise.
